                        Wrocław. We are constantly developing to create a community where people are becoming prepared

                        create amazing things together. We operate almost as an IT company, with management, PMs,

                    <p>
                        CodersCrew is getting bigger and bigger. We are communicating through Slack, mails, creating
                        Google Documents, we are working in Jira. But there is a need for a platform to organize better.
                        In the future, the site is to be available for other non-profit organizations to help them with
                        managing. CodersCrew has its own company image and structure. Work on the website began on the
                        part of UX, under the supervision of PM with the cooperation of programmers and with the help
                        and supervision of the client (management board).

                    <p>
                        Thanks to the platform- CodersBoard, the management board of the organization will be able to
                        add members, check payments statuses for membership fees, and approve new projects. Members will
                        be able to create their own profile, join projects, check projects progress and build their
                        business history from initiatives in which they are participating in.

                    <p>At the very beginning, CoderCrew members were surveyed using Google Surveys.</p>
                    <p>Main conclusions from the surveys:</p>
                    <p> - the section on projects, presentation of projects, description will be important<br>
                        - users have trouble finding information on meeting dates,<br>
                        - people do not know the leaders of the departments, they don’t know to whom to report on
                        various matters<br>
                        - a guide or mentor would be useful to introduce the new member to the association structure</p>

                    <h1>Event Storming</h1>
                    <p>The event storming took place with the entire project team and the management board of the
                        association. Thanks to this, it was possible to think together what activities we would like to
                        see in the platform first.
                    </p>
                    <p>Several of the most important user paths were analyzed:<br>
                        - Inviting people to CodersCrew<br>
                        - Removing a member from the association<br>
                        - Submitting and creating a new project
                    </p>
                    <p>Conclusions:</p>
                    <p>The most important thing for users and admins is adding new members to association, a view of all
                        tools/programs that are used in the association and a list of actual projects and people who
                        participate in them and their skills.

                    <p>User Journey Maps were created based on evenstorming.

                    <p>Thanks to the User Flows, the vision of individual screens to be designed began to clarify. To
                        prepare for this, an information architecture was created.</p>
                    <p>Six diagrams were created:</p>
                    <p> - Members list for admin<br>
                        - Account settings for a new member<br>
                        - Members list tab for a new member and a member<br>
                        - Design tab for the admin<br>
                        - Projects tab for a member<br>
                        - Structure of application for CoderCrew</p>
                    <p>As you can see there is three different paths: for a person during the trial period who wants to
                        be a member, for a member and for an admin That is why the platform needs to have 3 different
                        authorization systems.</p>

                    <p>We tested two people out of our association (potencials members), and two people from the
                        association using sketches (wireframes). The tests were conduted online. I was an observer at
                        one of the test, that was really great and refreshing experience.The form of the usability tests
                        was based on a book: “Don't Make Me Think” by Steve Krug.</p>
                    <h4>Prototypes</h4>

                        clients (management) to discuss about interfaces. After preparing the mockups, we started
                        preparing prototypes for testing.</p>
